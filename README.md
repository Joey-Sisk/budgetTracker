## Description

This Express Mongo DB web application is designed to allow a user track information about their finances and view data concerning their spending and income as a graph. Mongoose is used as a JavaScript framework in order to connect to and manipulate my NoSQL Mongo database and webpacks are used to compress the application for improved performance while a service worker allows for editing of data while offline.
